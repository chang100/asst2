# Assignment 2: Multithreaded Chat Server

**Due FIXME**

**100 points total + FIXME extra credit** 

In your second programming assignment, you will write the concurrent server component of a simple web-based AJAX chat system. You will have to spawn threads to handle incoming requests in parallel, use locks to protect access to the shared data structures, and use conditional wait and notify to block asynchronous queries when a new message has arrived.
